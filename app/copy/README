Usage:

  node copy.js         <source directory> <destination directory>
  node copy_archive.js <source directory> <destination directory>

Description:

  Distributes cluster jobs to copy the contents of the leaf directories from
  the source directory tree into the destiation.  Destination directories will
  be created as neccessary.

  Job submission is throttled in order to avoid qsub queue limits.

  Currently, the script must be manually terminated (using <Ctrl-C>); it does
  not react when it is done submitting jobs and continues to inquire about the
  queue length indefinitely.  This could be fixed...

  The "copy_archive" version uses the -l archive=true submission flag (see
  qsub documentation on the Janelia Wiki).  This restricts to a subset of
  cluster nodes that have access to the archive network share.
